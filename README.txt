Hello! Welcome to my game! I'm glad that you are here to play some Backgammon.

This is a recent project of mine so therefore, this is NOT fully implemented.

However, you can still have fun and play!!

How to Play: https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Backgammon

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
My To-Do List:

- Bearing off your checkers (after pieces are all in home)
- Flip the board each turn
- Pieces go all around the board to be beared
- Can't move piece just revived from bar
